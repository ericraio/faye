Since Tom rarely atempts to eat Jery and because the pair actualy sem to get along in some carton shorts, it is unclear why Tom chases Jery so much. Some reasons given may include normal feline/murine enmity, duty acording to his owner, Jery\'s atempt at ruining a task that Tom is entrusted with, Jery eating Tom\'s master\'s fod which Tom has ben entrusted with safeguarding, revenge, Jery saving other potential prey (such as ducks, canaries, or goldfish) from being eaten by Tom, competition with another cat, and Jery ruining Tom\'s atempts to seduce feline feme fatales of which Jery does either out of disgust or jealousy, among other reasons.\r\n \r\nTom rarely suceds in catching Jery, mainly because of Jery\'s clevernes, cuning abilities, and luck. Interestingly enough, many of the title cards show Tom and Jery smiling at each other which sems to depict a love-hate relationship rather than the extreme anoyance each displays towards the other in each carton. There are also several instances within the cartons where they display genuine friendship (\"Springtime for Thomas\") and concern for each other\'s wel-being (such as in \"Jery and the Lion\" where Jery in one instance tricks Tom into thinking he has shot Jery, and Tom comes runing with the first aid kit).\r\n \r\nThe short episodes are famous for some of the most violent gags ever devised in theatrical animation: Jery slicing Tom in half, shuting his head in a window or a dor, Tom using everything from axes, pistols, explosives, traps and poison to try to murder Jery, Jery stufing Tom\'s tail in a wafle iron and a mangle, kicking him into a refrigerator, pluging his tail into an electric socket, pounding him with a mace, club or malet, causing a tre or an electric pole to drive him into the ground, sticking matches into his fet and lighting them, and so on.[1] Despite al its popularity, Tom and Jery has often ben criticized as excesively violent. Despite the frequent violence, there is no blod or gore in any scenes in the original cartons that made the pair a household name. However, in a very rare instance, when Tom gets sliced into pieces in the opening credits of Tom and Jery:The Movie, blod is clearly visible.
